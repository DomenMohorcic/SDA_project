# INTRODUCTION

Our goal was to...


# ROLLER COASTERS DATASET

The dataset Coaster2015 presents data from various roller coasters across the globe. It has 16 attributes: name, park city, state, country, type, construction, height, speed, length, inversions, numinversions, duration, geforce, opened and region.


## Summary Statistics

```{r, echo=FALSE}
roller_coasters_raw <- readr::read_csv('datasets/roller_coasters.csv')
```

Coaster2015 dataset has 408 instances. As we can see, some values are missing. Attributes name, park city, state, country, type, construction and regian are categorical, while others are numerical. Where type and construction are basically the same attributes as seen later on...

```{r}
# GForce to many missing values..
summary(roller_coasters_raw)
```
Lets have a look at the categorical variables first. We will skip the Name and Park since they have too many unique values:

```{r}
length(unique(roller_coasters_raw$Name))
length(unique(roller_coasters_raw$Park))
length(unique(roller_coasters_raw$City))
```
As for the rest, look at the summary below:

```{r}
table(roller_coasters_raw$Country)
table(roller_coasters_raw$State) 
table(roller_coasters_raw$Type) # same as construction
table(roller_coasters_raw$Construction)
```

As for the numerical ones, we are generally most interested in speed. So we present most data relative to the speed of coasters. The speed is measured in milles per hour (mph), and its distribution relative to Construction can be seen here: 

```{r}
roller_coasters_raw %>% ggplot()+
  geom_density(aes(x = Speed, fill = Construction), alpha = 0.3)
```

We present the same data on a boxplot:

```{r}
ggplot(data = roller_coasters_raw) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = Construction, y = Speed, fill = Construction))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = roller_coasters_raw) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = Type, y = Speed, fill = Type))
```

From the density plot and boxplot we can observe that wooden coaster are on average faster than the steel ones. This will also be one of the hypothesis tests later on to confirm our observations. Also note, that Type and Construction are the same attributes.

Inversions also present some interesting data. When we have inversions we tend to have higher speeds as shown below on a density plot and box plot:

```{r}
roller_coasters_raw %>% ggplot()+
  geom_density(aes(x = Speed, fill = Inversions), alpha = 0.3)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = roller_coasters_raw) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = Inversions, y = Speed, fill = Inversions))
```


Last but not least, we compared the Countries and saw averages move from 50 to 75 mph, where US has the highest average:

```{r}
ggplot(data = roller_coasters_raw) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = Country, y = Speed, fill = Country))
```

We also tested symmetry of Speed distributions for Steel and wood constructions:

```{r}
symmetry.test(roller_coasters_raw$Speed)
symmetry.test(roller_coasters_raw[roller_coasters_raw$Construction == "Steel", ]$Speed)
symmetry.test(roller_coasters_raw[roller_coasters_raw$Construction == "Wood", ]$Speed)
```
We see that Speed is a symmetric distribution and also both Steel and Wood have symmetric distributions which will help us later in the hypothesis testing.


Other scatterplots are presented in the Regression section...


## Inference and Hypothesis testing

The usual procedure for hypothesis testing is such:

0) Check CLT conditions
Central limit theorem:
- Samples are independent,  
- Sample size is bigger or equal to 30,
- Population distribution is not strongly skewed.

1) Set-up the hypothesis

2) Assume threshold values
- $\alpha - significance level$ - typically 0.05

3) Calculate the Results:
- point est.
- number of cases
- sd - standard deviation
- se - standard error
- df - degrees of freedom $df = n-1$
- t-statistics
- p-value

4) Draw conclusions - Accept or reject hypothesis

If we meet those criteria, we can infer about the population based on the analysis we do on the sample. We firstly assume that all the instances are independant. We can also see that there are more than enough instances:

```{r}
roller_coasters_raw %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Speed)) %>% 
  nrow()

roller_coasters_raw %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Height)) %>% 
  nrow()

roller_coasters_raw %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Length)) %>% 
  nrow()

roller_coasters_raw %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Numinversions)) %>% 
  nrow()
```

Lastly, we want to see if the data is not heavily skewed:

```{r}
ggplot(roller_coasters_raw) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = Speed))
```
```{r}
ggplot(roller_coasters_raw) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = Length))
```
```{r}
ggplot(roller_coasters_raw) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = Height))
```

```{r}
ggplot(roller_coasters_raw) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = Numinversions))
```

From the above distributions we can observe that the most suitable distribution to make hypothesis testing on is Speed. And its symmetry is already proven in the summary statistics section...

We can also prove that Height, Length and Numinversions are not normally distributed nor are they symmetric using the symmetry and shapiro test below:

```{r}
(symmetry.test(roller_coasters_raw$Height))
(shapiro.test(roller_coasters_raw$Height))

(symmetry.test(roller_coasters_raw$Length))
(shapiro.test(roller_coasters_raw$Length))

(symmetry.test(roller_coasters_raw$Numinversions))
(shapiro.test(roller_coasters_raw$Numinversions))
```

As such, we are allowed to infere and do hypothesis testing on Speed, since only Speed meets the Limit Theorem requirements...

```{r}
roller_coasters_speeds <- roller_coasters_raw %>% 
  select(Speed) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Speed)) 
roller_coasters_speeds
```

### Hypothesis 1 - One sample t-test

Our hypothesis 1:

$H_0:$ population mean speed is 70mph $\mu = 70$
$H_A:$ population mean speed is not 70mph $\mu \neq 70$

$$ \alpha = 0.05 $$ 

Calculate the necessary variables:

```{r}
(point_est_speed <- 70)
(mean_speed <- mean(roller_coasters_speeds$Speed))
(sd_speed <- sd(roller_coasters_speeds$Speed)) # standard deviation
(sem_speed <- sd_speed / nrow(roller_coasters_speeds)) # standard error
(df_speed <- nrow(roller_coasters_speeds) - 1)
(t_speed <- (point_est_speed-mean_speed) / sem_speed)
```

p-value

```{r}
(p_val <- 2*(1- pt(t_speed, df = df_speed)))
```

95% confidence intervals

```{r}
#lower limit
# mean_speed - 1.96 * sem_speed
mean_speed + qt(0.025, df = df_speed) * sem_speed
#upper limit
# mean_speed + 1.96 * sem_speed
mean_speed + qt(0.975, df = df_speed) * sem_speed
```

Let's plot our discovery...
```{r}
xframe <- seq(-7, 7, length = 100)
ggplot(data.frame(x = xframe), aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dt, args = list(df = df_speed)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, y = 0, xend = 0, yend = dt(0, df = df_speed)),
               color = 'blue',
               linetype = 'dashed') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = t_speed, y = 0, xend = t_speed, yend = 0.4),
               color = 'red')
```

We reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.
Mean roller coaster speed is not 70mph!


### Hypothesis 2 - Difference of two means t-test

We want to check if the Wooden roller coasters are on average faster that the Steel ones.

```{r}
roller_coasters_steel <- roller_coasters_raw %>% 
  filter(Construction == "Steel" & !is.na(Speed))

roller_coasters_wood <- roller_coasters_raw %>% 
  filter(Construction == "Wood" & !is.na(Speed))
```

Check number of instances:

```{r}
nrow(roller_coasters_steel)
nrow(roller_coasters_wood)
```

Although already proven with symmetry test in the summary statistics, let's have a look at our distribution plots and their skewness:

```{r}
ggplot(roller_coasters_steel) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = Speed, y = ..density..), fill ='red') +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean(roller_coasters_steel$Speed), sd = sd(roller_coasters_steel$Speed)))
```

```{r}
ggplot(roller_coasters_wood) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = Speed, y = ..density..), fill ='red') +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean(roller_coasters_wood$Speed), sd = sd(roller_coasters_wood$Speed)))
```

This is enough to assume we can proceede with our hypothesis testing.

Our hypothesis 2:

$$ H_O: mean_{Wood} - mean_{Steel}  = 0 $$
$$ H_A: mean_{Wood} - mean_{Steel} \neq 0 $$

$$ \alpha = 0.05 $$ 


Calculate necessary variables:

```{r}
(point_est_const <- mean(roller_coasters_wood$Speed) - mean(roller_coasters_steel$Speed))
# (sample_sd <- sd(kiwi_gs_m$height_cm))
(SE <- sqrt((sd(roller_coasters_wood$Speed)^2/nrow(roller_coasters_wood)) + sd(roller_coasters_steel$Speed)^2/nrow(roller_coasters_steel)))
(df <- nrow(roller_coasters_wood) - 1) # less
(t_stat_const <- (point_est_const - 0) / SE) # t-score!
```

Plot our finding:

```{r}
ggplot(data.frame(x = seq(-7, 7, length = 100)), aes(x = x)) + 
  stat_function(fun = dt, args = list(df = df)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = t_stat_const, y = 0, xend = t_stat_const, yend = 0.4), color = 'red')
```

p-value:

```{r}
(p_val <- 2 * (1 - pt(t_stat_const, df)))
```

We reject the NULL hypothesis in favour of the alternative. The difference in means is significant
and wooden roller coasters go faster on average.


## Regression Analysis

Our goal is to make a linear regression model for prediction of a coasters Speed attribute.

### Correlation Analysis

Let's have a look at the correlations (Pearson) and see which are the best candidates.

```{r}
# precej zanimivi so Height, Length, Numinversions
(cor.test(roller_coasters_raw$Height, roller_coasters_raw$Speed))
(cor.test(roller_coasters_raw$Length, roller_coasters_raw$Speed))
(cor.test(roller_coasters_raw$Numinversions, roller_coasters_raw$Speed))
(cor.test(roller_coasters_raw$Duration, roller_coasters_raw$Speed))
(cor.test(roller_coasters_raw$GForce, roller_coasters_raw$Speed))
(cor.test(roller_coasters_raw$Opened, roller_coasters_raw$Speed)) # not good
```

We see that all are suitable for predition only Opened is not... 

From the pairplot below, we can observe that there are some linear or non linear relationships between length, height and speed:

```{r}
# pairs(roller_coasters, lower.panel = NULL)
```

### Regressoin Plots

To make sure we get the right attributes for our regression prediction of speed we wanted to take a look at the regression plots:

```{r}
roller_coasters_raw %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(aes(x = Height, y = Speed, color = Construction))
```

```{r}
roller_coasters_raw %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(aes(x = Length, y = Speed, color = Construction))
```

```{r}
roller_coasters_raw %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(aes(x = Duration, y = Speed, color = Construction))
```


We treated Numinversions as a categorical variable since it has too few values to make a proper regression plot.

```{r}
roller_coasters_raw %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = as.factor(Numinversions), y = Speed, color = Construction))
```

With every plot above we can see some linearity going on. But the best are definitely height, length, and categorical variable Construction, since the boxplot and hypothesis test clearly showed there is a significan difference between the average speeds.

We also wanted to show that GForce has to few values and not a good linear relationship, so that is why we won't include it into our prediction model:

```{r}
roller_coasters_raw %>% 
  filter(!is.na(GForce)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(aes(x = GForce, y = Speed))
```

### Regression

We prepared a cleaned dataset with only the variables that are going to predict speed.

```{r}
roller_coasters <- roller_coasters_raw %>% 
  select(Construction, Length, Height, Speed) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Speed) & !is.na(Height) & !is.na(Length)) %>% 
  mutate("Steel" = as.numeric(Construction == 'Steel')) %>% 
  select(-Construction)
roller_coasters
```

```{r}
## 75% of the sample size
smp_size <- floor(0.75 * nrow(roller_coasters))

## set the seed to make your partition reproducible
set.seed(123)
train_ind <- sample(seq_len(nrow(roller_coasters)), size = smp_size)

(train <- roller_coasters[train_ind, ])
(test <- roller_coasters[-train_ind, ])
```

For linear models we have to take care that the following hold:
1) Linearity of the data
2) Nearly normal residuals also check for outliers, mostly influencial outliers
3) Constant variability
4) Independent observations



```{r}
lin_model <- lm(Speed ~ ., data = train)
(summary(lin_model))
(coef(lin_model))
```

```{r}
rc_all <- lm(Speed ~ ., data = roller_coasters)
(summary(rc_all))
plot(rc_all)
```

```{r}
roller_coasters %>% ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(x = Height, y = Speed))+
  geom_smooth(aes(x = Height, y = Speed), method = lm)
```

```{r}
roller_coasters$log_height <- log(roller_coasters$Height)
roller_coasters$sq_height <- sqrt(roller_coasters$Height)

rc_all <- lm(Speed ~ sq_height, data = roller_coasters)
(summary(rc_all))
plot(rc_all)
```













# Red billed seagulls

The dataset seagulls.csv represents the data collected about seagulls in Auckland,
New Zeland. Dataset can be found [here](https://grapher.jake4maths.com/?folder=sneddon&dataset=GULLS.csv).

Data was collected on two seperate occasions (summer and winter) and on four
different locations: Muriwai (a), Piha (b), Mareatai (c), and Waitawa (d).

![Auckland region](seagulls.png)

They collected seagull's weight, length, and sex, as well as its
location and season. Authors of the dataset also point out that none of the
locations is a major breeding site.

We also cleaned dataset a bit. Some cases have misspelled "MURIWAI" as "MURWAI".
Variables location, coast, season, and sex have been converted from strings to
factors, and length was renamed to height, since that is more accurate varable
description.
```{r, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
seagulls <- read.csv("datasets/seagulls.csv")
seagulls[seagulls$LOCATION == "MURWAI",]$LOCATION <- "MURIWAI"
colnames(seagulls)[2] <- "HEIGHT"
seagulls$LOCATION <- as.factor(seagulls$LOCATION)
seagulls$COAST <- as.factor(seagulls$COAST)
seagulls$SEASON <- as.factor(seagulls$SEASON)
seagulls$SEX <- as.factor(seagulls$SEX)
```

## Summary statistics

Seagulls dataset has `r nrow(seagulls)` cases and 6 variables: weight, height,
location, coast, season, and sex. Weight and length are numerical, while location,
coast, season, and sex are categorical.
```{r summary_sg}
summary(seagulls)
```

Weight of seagulls is in grams (g), and its distribution can be seen here:
```{r sg_weightDistributionSex}
seagulls %>% ggplot()+
  geom_density(aes(x = WEIGHT, fill = SEX), alpha = 0.3)
```
Average weight of males is 278.73g with minimum of 235g and maximum of 320g.
Average weight of females is 262.49g with minimum of 212g and maximum of 302g.
We can see that weights of males are not normally distributed, while weights of
females could be. We can check this with normality test:
```{r sg_shapiroWeight}
shapiro.test(seagulls[seagulls$SEX == "MALE",]$WEIGHT)
shapiro.test(seagulls[seagulls$SEX == "FEMALE",]$WEIGHT)
```
We can see that weight is not normally distributed neither for males nor females,
but latter are very close to passing the normallity test. We can also check if
the distributions are at least symmetric:
```{r sg_symmetryWeight}
symmetry.test(seagulls[seagulls$SEX == "MALE",]$WEIGHT)
symmetry.test(seagulls[seagulls$SEX == "FEMALE",]$WEIGHT)
```
Both pass symmetry test, meaning they are not strongly skewed and can be used
later for inference.

Height of seagulls is in centimeters (cm):
```{r sg_heightDistributionSex}
seagulls %>% ggplot()+
  geom_density(aes(x = HEIGHT, fill = SEX), alpha = 0.3)
```
Average height of males is 37.74cm. Smallest male's height is 30cm, while largest
is 44.8cm. Female's average height is 36.5cm with minimum of 28.5cm and maximum
of 43.7cm.
Seagulls height seems more normally distributed than weight, but we can check:
```{r sg_shapiroHeight}
shapiro.test(seagulls[seagulls$SEX == "MALE",]$HEIGHT)
shapiro.test(seagulls[seagulls$SEX == "FEMALE",]$HEIGHT)
```
We can see that height for both sexes passes as normally distributed.

We have four locations in our dataset: Maraetai, Waitawa, Muriwai, and Piha. Coast
is either east or west and is a more broad description of location (Maraetai and
Waitawa are under east coast and Muriwai and Piha are under west coast). Locations
are almost equally represented in our dataset:
```{r sg_location}
table(seagulls$LOCATION) / nrow(seagulls)
```
Coast variable is also equaly distributed:
```{r sg_coast}
table(seagulls$COAST) / nrow(seagulls)
```

Season is either winter or summer. There are a little more entries for summer than
for winter, but the difference is miniscule:
```{r sg_season}
table(seagulls$SEASON) / nrow(seagulls)
```

There are more females presented in our dataset but the difference can be ignored:
```{r sg_sex}
table(seagulls$SEX) / nrow(seagulls)
```

We also drew some other plots representing how different variables are connected:
```{r}
seagulls %>% ggplot()+
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = LOCATION, y = WEIGHT, fill = SEX))
```
```{r}
seagulls %>% ggplot()+
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = SEASON, y = WEIGHT, fill = SEX))
```

## Inference

Since we can divide our datasets in many ways, we can also check many differnet
hypothesis.

### Is weight of males same on east and west coast?

We want to know if there is a difference between males in east and west coast.

$$H_0: mean_{east} - mean_{west} = 0$$
$$H_A: mean_{east} - mean_{west} \neq 0$$

We first divide our dataset into two smaller ones, which represent males from
different coasts.
```{r sg_inferenceSplit}
sg_east <- seagulls %>% filter(COAST == "EAST", SEX == "MALE")
sg_west <- seagulls %>% filter(COAST == "WEST", SEX == "MALE")
```

Next we need to check CLT conditions. Since samples were collected independently
from one another, first condition is true. Next we need to check if both samples
have sufficient size. There are `r nrow(sg_east)` males from east and `r nrow(sg_west)`
males from west. Both samples are larger than 30, so second condition is also true.
Then we need to check if any of samples is skewed. We can draw their distributions
and see that they both are somewhat symmetrical.
```{r sg_inferencePlot}
seagulls %>% filter(SEX == "MALE") %>% ggplot()+
  geom_density(aes(x = WEIGHT, fill = COAST), alpha = 0.3)
```
We can also calculate skewness of both distributions. Weight of males from east
coast have skewness of `r skewness(sg_east$WEIGHT)` and males from west have
skewness of `r skewness(sg_west$WEIGHT)`. Both values are small, so we can safely
say that neither distribution is strongly skewed.

We also need to check wether cases from groups are independant from each other.
Since they were collected on different locations, they are independant.
We can check if both groups are normally distributed. For that we can draw
histogram of weights and overlay it with normal distribution with same average
and standard deviation:
```{r sg_inferenceEast, message=FALSE}
east.mean <- mean(sg_east$WEIGHT)
east.sd <- sd(sg_east$WEIGHT)
sg_east %>% ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(x = WEIGHT, y = ..density..), fill = "green", color = "black")+
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = east.mean, sd = east.sd))
```
```{r sg_inferenceWest, message=FALSE}
west.mean <- mean(sg_west$WEIGHT)
west.sd <- sd(sg_west$WEIGHT)
sg_west %>% ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(x = WEIGHT, y = ..density..), fill = "orange", color = "black")+
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = west.mean, sd = west.sd))
```
Neither distribution seem normally distributed. We can further test that hypothesis
with normallity test:
```{r sg_inferenceShapiro}
shapiro.test(sg_east$WEIGHT)
shapiro.test(sg_west$WEIGHT)
```
Neither group has normal distribution, but they are symmetrical, so we will continue
with our hypothesis testing.

We set a threshold value $\alpha = 0.05$.

We calculate our point estimate, standard error, and t-score and plot it:
```{r sg_inferencePointEstimate}
point_estimate <- east.mean - west.mean
SE <- sqrt(east.sd ^ 2 / nrow(sg_east) + west.sd ^ 2 / nrow(sg_west))
df <- min(nrow(sg_east) - 1, nrow(sg_west) - 1)
t_score <- point_estimate / SE

ggplot(data.frame(x = seq(-6, 6, length = 200)), aes(x = x))+
  stat_function(fun = dt, args = list(df = df))+
  geom_vline(xintercept = t_score, color = "red")
```
We can see that our t-score (red line) falls to the left of student's t-distribution,
so our null hypothesis is very likely false. We can further confirm that with our
p-value calculation:
```{r sg_inferencePValue}
(p_value <- 2 * pt(t_score, df))
```
Since p-value is smaller than $\alpha$ (`r p_value` $< 0.05$), we reject $H_0$ in
favor of $H_A$. Seagulls on east and west coast do not weight the same. Because our
point estimate is negative, we can say that seagulls on west coast weight
more than seagulls on east coast.

### Are males and females equaly represented?

We want to know if males and females are equaly represented, that is, if ratio of
males to entire population is 50%.

$$ H_0: p_{males} = 0.50 $$
$$ H_A: p_{males} \neq 0.50 $$

Since samples in our dataset are independant observations, first CLT condition is
satisfied. We also have `r sum(seagulls$SEX == "MALE")` males and
`r sum(seagulls$SEX == "FEMALE")` females. Both numbers are greater than 10, so we
can proceed with categorical inference on proportion testing.

```{r}
ratio <- seagulls %>% filter(SEX == "MALE") %>% nrow() / nrow(seagulls)
SE <- sqrt(ratio * (1 - ratio) / nrow(seagulls))

ggplot(data.frame(x = seq(0.4, 0.6, length = 100)), aes(x = x))+
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0.5, sd = SE))+
  geom_vline(xintercept = ratio, color = "red")
```
```{r}
(p_value <- pnorm(ratio, mean = 0.5, sd = SE))
```
Since p_value of `r p_value` is greater than our threshold value of 0.05 we accept
the null hypothesis. There is the same number of males and females in seagull
population.

### Are the locations in our dataset representative?

We are interested if the locations in our dataset are represented equally.

$ H_0 $: Equal proportions of all locaitons

$ H_A $: Unequal proportions of all locations

We are goind to do a xhi-squared test for goodness of fit.

Collected data about locations is independant. All 4 categories also have at least
5 cases to them, so both chi-square test conditions are met.
```{r}
table(seagulls$LOCATION)
```

We need to calculate
expected count for each category and for every category we calculate its Z score
and then sum squares of Z scores together. Finally we check where on this
chi-squared distribution lies our score.
```{r}
num_classes <- length(unique(seagulls$LOCATION))
expected_location <- nrow(seagulls) / num_classes
z <- (table(seagulls$LOCATION) - expected_location) / sqrt(expected_location)
chi <- sum(z ^ 2)

df <- num_classes - 1

ggplot(data.frame(x = seq(0, 15, length = 100)), aes(x = x))+
  stat_function(fun = dchisq, args = list(df = df))+
  geom_vline(xintercept = chi, color = "red")
```
```{r}
(p_value <- 1 - pchisq(chi, df))
```
Since our p_value is smaller then $\alpha$ (`r p_value` $< 0.05$), we can reject
out null hypothesis in favor of alternative. Locations in our dataset are not
equaly represented.

## Linear regression

There is one more thing we want to know about seagulls: is the weight of a seagull
dependant of its height.

First we can take a look at height-weight graph:
```{r}
seagulls %>% ggplot(aes(x = HEIGHT, y = WEIGHT, color = SEX))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
```

It seems like there is really no connection between height and weight. We further
calculate its correlation coefficient:
```{r}
(c <- cor(seagulls$HEIGHT, seagulls$WEIGHT))
```

Correlation coefficient of `r c` hints that there is a weak correlation between
height and weight of seagulls. But we can still try and create a linear model
between those two variables:
```{r}
fit_wh <- lm(WEIGHT ~ HEIGHT, data = seagulls)
summary(fit_wh)
```
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(fit_wh, which=1:2)
```

We can se that residuals have no visible pattern and on the q-q plot the residuals
follow a nice line, so our model is valid. The most concerning thing is the R
squared value, which is only `r summary(fit_wh)$r.squared`.

We can also plot the density of residuals and see that they follow a normal
distribution.
```{r}
res <- residuals(fit_wh)
